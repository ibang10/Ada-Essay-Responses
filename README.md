Responses to the essay questions on the Ada Developer's Academy application


## 1. Why are you interested in programming?  What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, a few years ago I never would have considered a career in programming.  As a freshman in college I even did a little programming in one of my courses and at the time my interest fell short.  Technology and science had never been presented as a real option for me, and I had never considered a career in those fields. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interest in programming was piqued when someone close to me began a program in computer science.  He would often talk with me about computers and programming, and so I started looking into this as a career.  I read about types of jobs and I watched some online lectures about coding.  At this point I already knew that teaching was not a sustainable career for me, so I was thinking about what else was out there.  Because my first career hadn’t panned out the way I had hoped, I was enthusiastic to try something completely different.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew for certain that programming was for me after I began working on the Ada Jumpstart curriculum.  I had looked at the website and saw that people was encouraged to try that program to see if they enjoy the work.  I can now respond to that with a resounding yes, yes I do.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enjoyed the little introduction to programming that I have gotten because I like solving problems, especially logical ones.  It makes them seem possible to solve, even if overwhelming at times.  When I have been able to solve the problems through my own reading and online searching I have felt a type of success and autonomy that I have not felt since I went into teaching.  And this was just from a few practice exercises!  I feel empowered by the idea that one day I could create powerful programs that can make life easier, more accessible, and more interesting for humans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that draws me to a career in development is the breadth of opportunities.  The world is open when you have the skills to program.  Developers are needed in almost every facet of our society, that means that this career is a lot more sustainable as my interests and life circumstances may change. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say, my first exposure to “programming” would have been building my MySpace page using HTML back in eighth grade.  I was so excited to be able to search the web and find ways to turn my blank profile into a beautiful, clean representation of myself in the form of pretty backgrounds, words bolded and italicized in just the right way, buttons connecting to who knows where, and a song that perfectly captured what it meant to be me. More recently, A I began casually researching programming and started an online lecture type course with activities and coding games.  I have done most of the Jumpstart curriculum, which has exposed me to Ruby--I love Ruby.  I really enjoy how coding works in patterns so similar to language.  Language has always made sense to me, my favorite class in high school was Spanish and in college I loved learning French.  If only I had held onto those skills!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to feel more equipped to do some of the later assignments on Jumpstart I began doing the Codeacademy course for Ruby.  It was really quite shallow but I did learn a lot of things that weren’t included in Jumpstart.  After I finished the Codeacademy course I decided to look into other ways to learn Ruby, so now I am working on “Learn Ruby the Hard Way”.  Each of these “courses” have approached Ruby in a different way, so I am getting multiple perspectives and lots of practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from doing some practical coding work in Ruby, I have read online about what it is like to be a programmer and what types of jobs there are.  I have read about what the work environment is like.  What I have found from this research is exactly why I want to become a developer: it is challenging but rewarding; collaborative with plenty of room for autonomy; future focused;  and demanding of lifelong learning.  These are all values that I am looking for in my new career.

##2. If you are accepted into the program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In five years I certainly see myself doing front end web development, creating and improving websites is the most interesting to me.  Because I have a background and passion for education, I could see myself developing for an educational purpose. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my classroom I have used the web for student research, and have been sorely disappointed in what the internet has to offer.  So, perhaps I would work to create opportunities for young students to do internet research in a safe, navigable space which isn’t riddled with advertisements and, at times, odd information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teacher I also know how challenging it can be to efficiently find differentiated activities based on the Common Core Standards.  I currently have access to a software that allows me to give quick assessments and see which of my students need practice in which area, but then it is on me to scour the internet for activities to use with these kids.  I have frequently spent hours on the internet trying to sort through what really is just junk, mostly leaning on Pinterest, which I love, but is full of broken links and expensive activities.  Creating a clean, effective program that could bridge the gap between the assessment results and the activities that would support them is something I could potentially work on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a background in special education as well, and I know that this is a population that is often neglected in the global discussion on equity.  I could work to use technology to connect special education teachers and their students to relevant resources, or developing particular technologies that would be really supportive of students (or people in general) with disabilities.
