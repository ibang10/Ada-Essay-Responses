Responses to the essay questions on the Ada Developer's Academy application


## 1. Why are you interested in programming?  What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, a few years ago I never would have considered a career in programming.  As a freshman in college I even did a little programming in one of my courses and at the time my interest fell short.  Technology and science had never been presented as a real option for me, and I had never considered a career in those fields. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interest in programming was piqued when someone close to me began a program in computer science.  He would often talk with me about computers and programming, and so I started looking into this as a career.  I read about types of jobs and I watched some online lectures about coding.  At this point I already knew that teaching was not a sustainable career for me, so I was thinking about what else was out there.  Because my first career hadn’t panned out the way I had hoped, I was enthusiastic to try something completely different.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew for certain that programming was for me after I began working on the Ada Jumpstart curriculum.  I had looked at the website and saw that people were encouraged to try that program to see if they enjoy the work.  I can now respond to that with a resounding yes, yes I do.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enjoyed the little introduction to programming that I have gotten because I love solving problems, especially logical ones.  It makes them seem possible to solve, even if overwhelming at times.  As a teacher I run into a lot of problems that do not have logical solutions, if they can be solved at all.  When I have been able to solve the coding problems through my own reading and online searching I have felt a type of success and autonomy that I have not felt since I went into teaching.  And this was just from a few practice exercises!  I feel empowered by the idea that one day I could create powerful programs that can make life easier, more accessible, and more interesting for humans.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that draws me to a career in development is the breadth of opportunities.  The world is open when you have the skills to program.  Developers are needed in almost every facet of our society, that means that this career is a lot more sustainable as my interests and life circumstances may change. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first exposure to “programming” would have been building my MySpace page using HTML back in eighth grade.  I was so excited to be able to search the web and find ways to turn my blank profile into a beautiful, clean representation of myself in the form of pretty backgrounds, words bolded and italicized in just the right way, buttons connecting to who knows where, and a song that perfectly captured what it meant to be me. More recently, I began casually researching programming and started an online lecture type course with activities and coding games.  I have done most of the Jumpstart curriculum, which has exposed me to Ruby--I love Ruby.  I really enjoy how coding works in patterns so similar to language.  Language has always made sense to me, my favorite class in high school was Spanish and in college I loved learning French.  If only I had held onto those skills!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to feel more equipped to do some of the later assignments on Jumpstart I began doing the Codeacademy course for Ruby.  It was really quite shallow but I did learn a lot of things that weren’t included in Jumpstart.  After I finished the Codeacademy course I decided to look into other ways to learn Ruby, so now I am working on “Learn Ruby the Hard Way”.  Each of these “courses” have approached Ruby in a different way, so I am getting multiple perspectives and lots of practice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from doing some practical coding work in Ruby, I have read online about what it is like to be a programmer and what types of jobs there are. What I have found from this research is exactly why I want to become a developer: it is challenging but rewarding; collaborative with plenty of room for autonomy; future focused;  and demanding of lifelong learning.  These are all values that I am looking for in my new career.

##2. If you are accepted into the program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In five years I certainly see myself doing front end web development, creating and improving websites is the most interesting to me.  Because I have a background and passion for education, I could see myself developing for an educational purpose. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my classroom I have used the web for student research, and have been sorely disappointed in what the internet has to offer for children's research.  So, perhaps I would work to create opportunities for young students to do internet research in a safe, navigable space which isn’t riddled with advertisements and, at times, odd information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teacher I also know how challenging it can be to efficiently find differentiated activities based on the Common Core Standards.  I currently have access to a software that allows me to give quick assessments and see which of my students need practice in which area, but then it is on me to scour the internet for activities to use with these kids.  I have frequently spent hours on the internet trying to sort through what really is just junk, mostly leaning on Pinterest, which I love, but is full of broken links and expensive activities.  Creating a clean, effective program that could bridge the gap between the assessment results and the activities that would support them is something I could potentially work on because it would be really valuable for educators.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a background in special education as well, and I know that this is a population that is often neglected in the global discussion on equity.  I could work to use technology to connect special education teachers and their students to relevant resources, or developing particular technologies that would be really supportive of students (or people in general) with disabilities.

## 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I will contribute to Ada’s vision of inclusivity and diversity because I have grown up both in life and professionally with a strong belief in these values.  I specifically chose my undergraduate institution knowing that social justice is woven into its very framework.  Almost every course there is created through the lens of equity, and an urgency to question and think critically about how the ideas presented are affecting the disempowered.  I can’t help but ask myself these questions daily in my personal reflections and conversations. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During college I became an AmeriCorps member which was an opportunity I will forever be grateful for.  I served in a low-income school and was able to build connections with teachers, students, and the local community that I would not have done otherwise.  I learned more about social justice through my AmeriCorps teammates than I ever had before, and my mind was opened in ways I didn’t understand until I was able to work in the thick of it, experiencing and observing issues that I was only theorizing about in my college classes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a senior, I spent most of my year in a program focused on issues of race and equity in the education system.  We studied Critical Race Theory and did qualitative research in classrooms to examine effects on culture in public school settings.  This work has given me a foundation in how to exist as a critical thinker in a society that demands this of us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went into education with this mindset, truly believing that I would be able to make a difference in in the world by pursuing this field.  A combination of politics, misalignment of expectation and reality, and my own professional preferences have lead me to realize that the classroom is not for me.  This does not mean that I have lost a drop of the fervor that I felt about bringing relevance and equity to people of all backgrounds (I find myself particularly passionate about issues of race and social class, and their intersection).  I would look forward to bringing my knowledge and experiences to the Ada cohort, as well as an eagerness to listen to the narratives of others to build community and new learning.

## 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from.  If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartbreaking for me to admit that choosing teaching as a profession was a mistake.  For years many I have been emotionally and educationally invested in this path; I never truly saw myself doing anything else, and that was the problem--I didn’t even consider my options.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew pretty quickly once I had my own classroom that I would not be able to maintain this job for a lifetime.  I persevered because I made a commitment to that school and those kids.  Even then I decided to take on another year of teaching in hopes that a different building, culture, and grade level would change my mind--it hasn’t.  In fact, the moment I truly knew that teaching really wasn’t for me was when my co-teacher said, “Oh, well you are really new.  I bet you still just have so much fun with all this stuff [grading, lesson planning, etc.]” and I thought, no...I do this because it's important and because I made a commitment. 	

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a teacher in and of itself was not a mistake--I have gained valuable professional experience from this job and I have discovered a lot about who I am as a person and as an employee.  The mistake was the mountain of student loan debt that I have built for myself.  There are a lot of reasons that I jumped right into graduate school from college, and a lot of what it boils down to is me feeling like I had very few options.  I was determined to be financially stable as soon as possible, but more importantly it was a “dream” that I had nursed for years without exploration of other paths.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am facing this situation again right now, in a way.  I am at a crossroads where I need to make a career choice.  What I have taken from this experience is that life is long, and I should be doing something I love that is not going to leave me burnt out in two years.  I have discovered my own sense of resiliency and ability to work through a job that really pushes me.  I have learned how important it is to build strong relationships with coworkers because that is what has gotten me through the really tough days. Most importantly, I know that I can’t jump into a new career just because it is seems like something I should do--especially when there are serious financial implications.  I would not go back to school again at this point.  Regardless of if I get into Ada, I will learn to program.  I will stop teaching because a final lesson I have learned is that I do have the power to leave this job, and take a risk (something I have never been great at) on a career that I truly believe is right for me, and for the right reasons this time.
